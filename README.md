>Front-end developed during Rocketseat bootcamp.
First of all this application was devoloped for learning more about web development and acquiring experience, knowledge
and skills in **_Javascript_**, **_Typescript_**. 
>Also i've developed a back-end based on API Restful page with _Typescript_ and express library and you can find it on this [link](https://github.com/ghsroriz/ecoleta-ApiRest).

Anyone who own's for example a market can register their businnes location as a point of collection of this materials. The website cotains a map where you can show exactly where is your business location. Than you tell us the name, e-mail, WhatsApp number, city and state. After all this  you will submit us your data and a image of the building and that's it, now you are registered in our data base as a collection point.

### Front End 
> We developed this front-end using React. It was not so dificult because this project is simple. And you're asking yourself why i haven't configured the view on github pages... I decided to split in 2 parts, to show anyone that i can develop both back and front-end, no matter what needs the project wants from me and, some features are stored on another git repository, so maybe some conflicts will happen. But if are interested in, donwload both api and front-end and ... Be happy. Take a look at anything you want, make yourself at home.
